Lexer:
-------
 - Bind matching strings to regular definitions: 
    -> Bind "4c" in "0x4c" to `hex` from regex (0x|0X){hex}
    -> Variables in repetitions instead become lists/iterators
 - Print errors on failed regex parse
 - Show were lexing errors occur in the input file

Parser:
--------
 - Bindings inside star patterns (e.g. (COMMA <es: expr>)*) should form their own Vec
 - Include infix operator construct to resolve left associativity issues
 - Add ? and | operators in BackusNaur form
 - Improve efficiency
 - Translate BNF grammars to a more suitable form for a recursive descent parser
 - Show were parsing errors occur in the input file
