/// Returns true if the given character has significance in a regex.

/// Generally speaking, these are the only characters which _must_ be escaped
/// in order to match their literal meaning. For example, to match a literal
/// `|`, one could write `\|`. Sometimes escaping isn't always necessary. For
/// example, `-` is treated as a meta character because of its significance
/// for writing ranges inside of character classes, but the regex `-` will
/// match a literal `-` because `-` has no special meaning outside of character
/// classes.
///
/// In order to determine whether a character may be escaped at all, the
/// [`is_escapeable_character`] routine should be used. The difference between
/// `is_meta_character` and `is_escapeable_character` is that the latter will
/// return true for some characters that are _not_ meta characters. For
/// example, `%` and `\%` both match a literal `%` in all contexts. In other
/// words, `is_escapeable_character` includes "superfluous" escapes.
///
/// Note that the set of characters for which this function returns `true` or
/// `false` is fixed and won't change in a semver compatible release. (In this
/// case, "semver compatible release" actually refers to the `regex` crate
/// itself, since reducing or expanding the set of meta characters would be a
/// breaking change for not just `regex-syntax` but also `regex` itself.)

/// Returns true if the given character can be escaped in a regex.

/// This returns true in all cases that `is_meta_character` returns true, but
/// also returns true in some cases where `is_meta_character` returns false.
/// For example, `%` is not a meta character, but it is escapeable. That is,
/// `%` and `\%` both match a literal `%` in all contexts.
///
/// The purpose of this routine is to provide knowledge about what characters
/// may be escaped. Namely, most regex engines permit "superfluous" escapes
/// where characters without any special significance may be escaped even
/// though there is no actual _need_ to do so.
///
/// This will return false for some characters. For example, `e` is not
/// escapeable. Therefore, `\e` will either result in a parse error (which is
/// true today), or it could backwards compatibly evolve into a new construct
/// with its own meaning. Indeed, that is the purpose of banning _some_
/// superfluous escapes: it provides a way to evolve the syntax in a compatible
/// manner.
